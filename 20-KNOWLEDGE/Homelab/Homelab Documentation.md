# Homelab Documentation System & Strategy

## 🏗️ Documentation Architecture

### Primary Documentation Hub

**Recommended Tool**: **Obsidian** (local) or **Notion** (cloud-based)

- **Why**: Interconnected notes, templates, databases, and excellent search
- **Alternative**: GitBook, BookStack, or simple Git repository with Markdown

### Secondary Tools

- **Network Diagrams**: draw.io (now diagrams.net) or Lucidchart
- **Password/Secrets**: Vaultwarden or Bitwarden
- **Code/Configs**: Git repository (GitLab/GitHub/Gitea)
- **Screenshots**: Built into your documentation tool or ShareX

## 💡 Pro Tips for Effective Documentation
#Homelab_tips 

### Writing Guidelines

- **Be Future-You Friendly**: Write like you’ll forget everything in 6 months
- **Include Context**: Why you made decisions, not just what you did
- **Use Screenshots**: Visual documentation for complex configurations
- **Version Control**: Keep configuration backups and track changes
- **Regular Updates**: Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation

### Automation Ideas

- **Config Backups**: Automated backup of important configuration files
- **Infrastructure Diagrams**: Tools like nmap + scripts to auto-generate network maps
- **Service Discovery**: Scripts to automatically update service inventories
- **Learning Analytics**: Track time spent learning different topics

### Integration Opportunities

- **Monitoring Integration**: Link documentation to Grafana dashboards
- **Git Integration**: Store configurations in Git with commit messages
- **Calendar Integration**: Track learning time and schedule reviews
- **Screenshot Automation**: Tools like ShareX for consistent documentation

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Progress Tracking

- **Milestone Completion**: Percentage of milestones achieved
