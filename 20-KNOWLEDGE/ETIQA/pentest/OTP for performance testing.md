Background and requirements:
- want to implement hardcoded OTP for performance testing
- OTP will always be 000000 when being passed a secret key, if a config for the performance testing is enabled.
- this will impacts:
	- request otp for email
	- request otp for phone
- do not send sms if the performance testing is enabled

rules:
- no sms will be sent
- data for otp will still be created in mongo db, but the value of the otp will always be 000000
- ask me a yes or no question

pre-requisites:
- performance_test_is_enabled in config must be set to true
- only on UAT
